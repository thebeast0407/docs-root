# Introduction

[BigchainDB](https://www.bigchaindb.com/) is a scalable blockchain database.
That is, it's a "big data" database with some blockchain characteristics, including [decentralization](https://bigchaindb.readthedocs.io/projects/server/en/latest/topic-guides/decentralized.html), 
[immutability](https://bigchaindb.readthedocs.io/projects/server/en/latest/topic-guides/immutable.html) 
and 
[native support for assets](https://bigchaindb.readthedocs.io/projects/server/en/latest/topic-guides/assets.html).

You can read about the motivations, goals and high-level architecture in the [BigchainDB whitepaper](https://www.bigchaindb.com/whitepaper/).


**Is BigchainDB Production-Ready?**

No, BigchainDB is not production-ready. You can use it to build a prototype or proof-of-concept (POC); many people are already doing that.

BigchainDB Server is currently in version 0.X. ([The Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases) has the exact version number.) Once we believe that BigchainDB Server is production-ready, we'll release version 1.0.

[The BigchainDB Roadmap](https://github.com/bigchaindb/org/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) will give you a sense of the things we intend to do with BigchainDB in the near term and the long term.
